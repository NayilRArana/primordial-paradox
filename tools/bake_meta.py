"""bake_meta: write `data/meta_bake.json` ahead of time, offline and total (card R29, spec 19, D5).

Why this tool exists
====================
`knowledge/GAMEDEV-DECISIONS-2026-10-22.md` D5 says the shipped game makes no network call and holds no
key, and every Meta model output the game shows was baked before the build by a tool into a plain data
file. This is that tool for spec 19's talk path: for every fight phase the talk command can reach and for
the two NPCs D6 Q5 approved (Morgan the gate sentry, Nye the dock office clerk) it writes three reply
options, the effect each option is allowed to move, and a hint line, in the shape of spec 19 section 4
(1 to 4 lines of at most 28 characters, one mood of five, one effect of five, a hint of at most 28).

Every row records what D5 asks for: `model`, `request_hash`, `created_at` and `fallback`, where
`fallback` is the hand written row the row shadows. The fallback is never invented here:

  fight rows   the card's own pool line in `data\\talk_cards.json`, chosen by the effect the option moves
               (soften reads the weak pool, nudge the neutral pool, setback the strong pool), uppercased
               into the 46 glyph alphabet and wrapped to at most 28 columns. Nothing else changes.
  npc rows     the hand written line bank in `knowledge\\GATE-DIALOGUE.md` (R38), a bank line id per turn,
               already inside the alphabet, so it is copied verbatim and checked byte for byte.

A row whose source is `fallback` says so (`"source": "fallback"`, `"network": false`) and carries the
reason it fell back (`"reason"`: no key, no network, a refusal, a cap). A row never claims a live call it
did not make; R43 REVIEW-META-BAKE checks exactly that, and a fallback row's `text`, `mood`, `effect` and
`hint` must be its fallback's four fields byte for byte, so a fallback row cannot show words no fallback
holds (`--check` compares them, R43 B2).

The `bake` block is derived from the calls, not from the environment (R43 B1)
==================================================================================
`resolve_mode()` reads what the environment permits; it is never evidence that a call happened. The block
is built by `bake_header()` from the run's own tally: `live` counts the validated answers written into
rows, and each one is either `live_wire` (answered over the network now) or `live_cached` (read back from
the recorded cache). So:

    mode live      at least one validated answer crossed the network this run, and `network` is true
    mode replay    the rows are validated answers read back from the recorded cache, `network` false
    mode offline   no row is live, whatever the environment allowed, `network` false

and the note always starts with `live:`, `cached:` or `offline:` to match. A run whose every call missed
the cache (a replay with nothing recorded) or whose key is revoked or spent writes mode offline, network
false and an offline note, not a live header over 0 live rows. A validated answer whose transport verdict
is missing, or which the door places neither on the wire nor in the cache, stops the bake rather than being
labelled from a guess, so `live` always equals `live_wire` plus `live_cached`.

Three modes, and none of them blocks
====================================
    python tools\\bake_meta.py --offline    # every row is the hand written fallback, no key, no network
    python tools\\bake_meta.py              # try the live call, fall back row by row, never fail the bake
    python tools\\bake_meta.py --check      # re-read the file and refuse anything off contract

No key, no network, a refusal or a spent call budget writes the fallback for that row and says so. The
bake never leaves a hole: a missing key is a labelled file, not an error, because a hole in the bake is a
box that says nothing on a judge's laptop. A missing or too short `data\\talk_profanity.json` is the one
loud stop, because spec 19 section 7 layer D says so.

The key is read from the environment by `tools\\meta_client.py`, never here, and never printed. This file
holds no endpoint and no credential: `--check` refuses the bake if it finds a URL or a key name in it.

What --check refuses
====================
    1. a line over 28 characters, more than 4 lines, an empty line, or a character outside the font
       (read from `data\\ui_layouts.json`, not typed here) or outside spec 19 section 4's pattern;
    2. a mood outside the five, or an effect outside spec 19's enum, or `end` in a fight, or soften,
       nudge or setback in chat (spec 19 section 6 rule 2);
    3. a fallback id that does not resolve: a talk_cards id (`<card>:<pool>:<index>`) whose card is not in
       `data\\talk_cards.json` or whose pool or index does not exist, or a gate_dialogue id that is not a
       line id in `knowledge\\GATE-DIALOGUE.md`, and either kind whose stored text is not the text that id
       really holds;
    4. a row missing `model`, `request_hash`, `created_at`, `fallback`, `source` or `text`, a
       `request_hash` that does not recompute from the row's stored request echo, a duplicate id, a row
       whose scene and effects disagree, an incomplete option set, or a card phase the data can reach that
       the bake quietly dropped;
    5. a key name, an endpoint, a URL, or an unvalidated model answer, anywhere in the file;
    6. a bake block that claims more than its rows did: mode live or network true over zero live rows, an
       offline flag that disagrees with the network flag, or a note that does not begin with the run's own
       word (`live:`, `cached:` or `offline:`); and a row labelled fallback whose shown text, mood, effect
       or hint is not its fallback's, or a fallback reason that names none of the four causes (R43 B1, B2).

Usage
    python tools\\bake_meta.py --offline
