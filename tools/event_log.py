r"""event_log.py: regenerate EVENT-LOG.md, the timestamped log of the work done during the event (card t_da72cf80).

Why: the Meta AI Developer Hackathon runs 2026-10-26 to 2026-11-04 and asks for the work done during the
event, with the demo and the write-up judged on it. A log written by hand goes stale on the first long
night, so this tool writes it from git instead, and the log cannot disagree with the repository it
describes. Every commit that touches projects/primordial-paradox after the baseline tag is one line:

    <local commit time> | <short sha> | <card id> | <subject>

The card id is picked out of the subject when the subject names one, and the newest commit is last, so
reading down the file is reading the event in the order it happened. The first line of the file states
the baseline tag and the commit it points at, so a reader can see what the log counts from without git.

A commit that touches nothing but this file is the log being refreshed, not work done in the window, so
it is not a row. It cannot be: the file in that commit cannot name the commit that carries it, so a
--check that demanded that row would stay red on an otherwise clean tree forever. A commit that touches
this file beside real work is still a row; only a commit whose whole change is the log drops out.

The tag's commit is resolved from the tag, never typed in here: a tag moved on purpose must move the log
with it, and a tag that does not exist is an error rather than an empty log.

Usage:
  python tools/event_log.py            write EVENT-LOG.md, then print the line count and the first two lines
  python tools/event_log.py --check    write nothing: exit 1 when the file on disk would change
  python tools/event_log.py --print    write nothing: print the text it would write

Cards and lanes both run this: the nightly demo card runs it after the gates, so the log is refreshed on
a night when work landed without anyone remembering to ask.
