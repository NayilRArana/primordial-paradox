"""Mirror the title art from game\\sprites_src\\title\\ into the build as Included Files.

The art lane (TS-A, TS-B, TS-C) writes one PNG plus one JSON per animation into
game\\sprites_src\\title\\. The engine cannot read that folder at runtime, so this script copies the PNGs into
game\\datafiles\\art\\ and writes one index, game\\datafiles\\art\\title_manifest.json, that the runtime reads to know
every animation's frame size and frame count.

game\\datafiles\\art\\ is build output: it is gitignored, and this script is the only thing that writes it. The
authored tree is game\\sprites_src\\, and since card t_4e54cc9e the sprite queue in data\\sprite_redraw_queue.json
measures there too. The older folder game\\art\\ is retired and deleted: this script never wrote it, the game never
read it, and a redraw left in it reached nothing that ships.

The index is the contract between the art lane and the game: the game asks for a name and gets a frame count,
so a sprite that has not landed yet simply is not in the index and the game draws a rectangle in its place.

Deterministic: the index is written with sorted keys and LF endings, so the same art gives the same bytes.

Usage:
    python tools/sync_art.py
    python tools/sync_art.py --check      # exit 1 if the mirror is stale
    python tools/sync_art.py --no-project # mirror only, leave the .yyp alone

A write run ends by regenerating game\\PrimordialParadox.yyp from the mirror it just wrote, because
every file under game\\datafiles is an Included File in that project. That is what stops a landed cue
from leaving the .yyp stale (card t_e40f9705).
