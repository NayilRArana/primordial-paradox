"""play_demo.py: one command that plays a scripted run of the built game and records it to an mp4.

Why this file exists: the hackathon submission needs a video of real gameplay that can be re-recorded the
night before the deadline, by one command, without a person at the keyboard and without a new take each
time something in the title moves. So the run is data (data/demo/run_001.json: key presses on a 60 step a
second clock, the seeds the slice actually reaches, and the game's own log lines as the sync points), and
this tool is the player.

It is not a second capture harness. Every window and key primitive is the one tools/capture_title.py
already proved on this PC: the window is found by process image name (not by title), it is raised with the
foreground lock lifted, every key goes through the input queue because a GameMaker game reads key state and
a posted key is a dud, and the rectangle is checked for a covering window before and after recording. What
this file adds is the script, the clock, the ffmpeg recording at 60 fps cut to a true 3x of the NES screen,
and a check that the result is a video of the game and not of a terminal.

The mp4 is 768x720, which is exactly 3x the 256x240 screen the game draws (measured: a 768x720 viewport at
[8, 31] inside a 784x759 window, tests/test_capture_title.py). The window rectangle is recorded as it is
and then cropped to the viewport that tools/nes_composite_check.py finds in a pre-roll frame, so the frame
is the game's own pixels and not the desktop's scaling of them. A frame of a terminal, of the desktop or of
a cover window has no such viewport and is refused.

Audio: system audio needs a loopback device, and this host reports none (tools/capture_title.py records the
same). When there is no loopback the video is recorded silent and a stand-in track is rendered from the
title theme that ships in the repo, then muxed in and labelled in the mp4's own metadata and in the verify
file. It is never passed off as the game's live output.

Pollution (card t_5d1a6ec4): the rectangle is asked who owns it every second while the recording runs, not
only before and after, and its pixels are read once a second as well. A foreign window found there stops the
run and marks the take POLLUTED, named by the process that owned the pixels; it is never reported as the art
lane's finding. A take checked from disk alone (`--check`) has no run log, so there the verdict comes from the
frames: a sampled frame with fewer than half its pixels on the 2C02 palette is not the game, because the game
resolves every colour through data/palette_ppu.json, and a frame between that floor and the 0.90 palette floor
is the art lane's. Measured on 2026-10-26: 33 frames of the game scored 0.9285 to 0.9939, the two covered
frames of the demo-box take scored 0.0024 and 0.0025.

Usage:
    python tools\\play_demo.py                        play data\\demo\\run_001.json and record output\\demo\\run_001.mp4
    python tools\\play_demo.py --script data\\demo\\x.json --out output\\demo\\x.mp4
    python tools\\play_demo.py --check                re-check the mp4 the script names, without launching the game
    python tools\\play_demo.py --check --video P.mp4  check some other file the same way
    python tools\\play_demo.py --dry-run              validate the script and print the timeline in seconds

Exit codes:
    0  the recording passed every check, or --check passed, or --dry-run validated the script
    1  a check failed, or the script is malformed, or the game window never appeared
    3  the watchdog fired (the run overran)
    4  the idle gate refused to open a window: the user had input in the last three minutes (card CAPTURE-QUIET),
       or this host cannot draw at all, in which case the run is not measured and nothing is claimed about it

Quiet by default (card CAPTURE-QUIET, Nayil 2026-10-22): the game is started with PP_MUTE=1 so nothing plays, no
window opens unless the idle gate in tools\\idle_check.py sees three quiet minutes, and the window is moved off the
primary screen. --sound is for an audio proof, --show leaves the window where it is, --force is a human override.

Portable import (card PINE-HONEST, 2026-10-24): the two modules this tool draws and launches with,
tools\\capture_title.py and tools\\pp_launch.py, import ctypes.wintypes at their own line 39 and line 41, which raises
on a host without the Windows path. Imported at the top of this file they killed it before it could say anything, and
that traceback, not a test result, is what 19 of the 21 Pine reds measured on 2026-10-24 were. Both are now imported
inside the function that uses them, and a host that cannot import them prints one line, "play_demo: unavailable on
this platform", and exits 4 (the harness's not-measured lane, EXIT_REFUSED) instead of passing
silently or going red.

    The four checks the card asks for, in the order a wrong recording shows up:
      1. the duration is at least record.min_seconds of real gameplay;
      2. the frame is the script's 3x of the 256x240 screen, at the script's fps;
      3. sampled frames are not black;
      4. sampled frames are the game and not a terminal: enough of them must sit on the legal 2C02 palette
         within the tolerance a compressed frame needs, and two samples must differ, so the scene moves.

    And the two this card added (t_5d1a6ec4):
      5. a frame that is off the palette is split by how far off it is. Under OFF_PALETTE_ART_MIN fewer than
         half its pixels are 2C02 colours, which no drawing mistake produces, so it is "not the game" and the
         take fails as polluted; between that floor and palette_share_min it stays the art lane's finding.
         SUMMARY text no longer sends the art lane to look at a frame that is a terminal window.
      6. `pollution` is what the run's pollution watch saw while recording (who owned the rectangle, and any
         unexplained whole-screen jump). A covered sample fails the take by name and stops the recording, so a
         window raised over the game mid-run is a polluted take and never an art finding. When the take is
         checked from disk alone (`--check`) there is no run log, so the check says UNMEASURED rather than
         pretending either way, and check 5 is what holds.

    The exact 3x viewport search (capture_title.viewport_box_and_score) is deliberately not run on these
    frames: it asks for exact palette colours, which is the right question on a PNG taken straight off the
    game's screen, and it is the pre-roll frame's job before the recording starts. On an h264 frame it
    returns 0.0 for a real frame of the game (measured on the 2026-10-22 run_001: the title frame scored 0.0
    with a palette share of 0.93), so using it here would only manufacture a contradiction.
