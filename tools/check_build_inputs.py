"""Every Included File the committed project demands must resolve to a source the commit carries.

Why this exists. The audit nightly builds a detached worktree at HEAD, so a file that lives only in
the live tree is absent there while the suite that reads it sits fine in the working tree. On
2026-10-22 that cost 88 failures and 23 errors at commit dc104a7. Four theme .ogg streams and two
.mid scores were named as Included Files by the committed game/PrimordialParadox.yyp while the
commit did not contain them, and the two MIDI exceptions in the root .gitignore sat above the
blanket *.mid rule, so they had never taken effect at all. The suite reported that as dozens of
unrelated FileNotFoundError.

This reports it as one named failure instead. It is the cheap assertion the audit asked for.

THE TWO DIRECTIONS, because they catch different halves and only one of them works in a worktree.

Direction A, project to source. Read every GMIncludedFile in the .yyp, which is what the committed
project says it needs, resolve each to the source tools/sync_art.py copies it from, and require that
source to be tracked. This works in a bare HEAD worktree, where the missing files are simply not on
disk, so nothing can be learned by walking the tree. This is the direction that catches dc104a7.

Direction B, source to project. Walk the sources sync_art will mirror and require each to be
tracked. This catches the live-tree case, where a lane drops a new theme .ogg into a folder and the
mirror will pick it up on the next run while the file is uncommitted. It cannot fire in a worktree,
because an uncommitted file is not there.

Direction C, the staged pairing, judged against the INDEX, behind --staged. A commit is the index,
so the only honest way to judge what a commit will carry is to read the index rather than the
working tree: `git ls-files` already reads the index, and the index copy of the project file is
`git -C <repo> show :<repo-relative yyp path>`. Measured 2026-10-24 in a scratch repository:
`git add staged_only.ogg` with nothing committed puts staged_only.ogg in `git ls-files`, while
Direction A opens the WORKING TREE .yyp, which by commit time is already regenerated. So the shape
"three oggs staged, yyp unstaged" exited 0 while the commit would have declared three streams it did
not carry; it only reddened while the oggs were still UNTRACKED, which is why six recurrences each
looked green until the moment of the commit. Direction C is the only direction that can judge a
staged commit, because a commit is the index.

Direction C's word is UNPAIRED IN COMMIT, never MISSING FROM COMMIT or UNCOMMITTED SOURCE, because
run_suites.py and the gate log grep for those two exact strings to count what the older directions
found. Directions A and B are deliberately NOT re-run under --staged: they read the working tree and
the whole tracked set, and on this tree one shared index carries several lanes' work, so a lane's
commit must not be refused for a file another lane has not committed yet. The nightly and
tests/test_build_inputs.py keep their meaning, which is why the flag is what turns Direction C on.

Scope, stated so nobody over-reads it. This checks delivery inputs mirrored into game/datafiles. It
does not check generated project resources, which tools/gen_project.py owns, and it does not check
the mirror itself, because game/datafiles is generated and deliberately gitignored.
