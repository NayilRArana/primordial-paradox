"""nes_audit_all.py: run the NES checkers over every art file in this project and say what to fix.

The card is PALETTE-AUDIT (t_3de37cbc): "run the NES checkers on every art asset in the project and list
fixes". This tool is the runner. It does not invent a rule and it does not soften one: the verdict for each
file is whatever `tools\\nes_check.py` (one sheet or layer, sprite tiles or 16x16 background areas) or
`tools\\nes_composite_check.py` (one finished 256x240 frame, both layers together) returns. Both are imported
and called directly, so the audit measures exactly the code the project already trusts, without paying a
process spawn per file.

What it audits, and why each scope is gated or not:

1. `asset`: every PNG under `game\\sprites_src\\`. GATED. These are the shipped art sources. A sheet whose
   sibling .json exists (or whose name starts `spr`) is a GameMaker sprite sheet and is checked under the
   sprite rules; a layer named `title_*`, `BG*` or with no sibling is checked under the background rules.
   The naming rule is in `classify_asset()` and it is deterministic: same name, same scope, every run.
2. `frame`: `output\\*preview*.png` that is exactly 256x240. GATED. It is one finished frame, so
   `nes_composite_check.py` judges it, background and sprites together.
3. `sheet`: every other `output\\*preview*.png`. ADVISORY. These are 3x contact sheets built to be looked at by
   a person; a 3x sheet is downsampled by nearest to the 1x art before the background rules run, so the
   failure still names the real art, but a contact sheet is a viewing aid and not a shipped asset.
4. `capture`: `output\\title_run_*.png`, the window captures of the running game. ADVISORY. A window capture
   carries the GameMaker compositor's own scaling, so a red there can measure the capture path instead of the
   art. It is still reported, and an unreadable capture is UNMEASURED, never a pass.

A SKIP is not a pass, so a file the checker cannot read is counted as UNMEASURED and the tool exits 1 on it
when the file is gated (PLAN-V2-2026-10-21.md section 0: measurable checks, no silent greens).

One red number is not one kind of red, so every record carries a `class` and every report prints the failed
count per class (card t_b8e56b9d). The four scopes ARE the classes: `asset`, `frame`, `sheet`, `capture`. A
`frame` red is a shipped 256x240 screen and it gates; a `sheet` or `capture` red is a contact sheet or a window
capture and it is advisory; an `asset` red is shipped art and it gates. Printing "35 failing" over all four
invites a reader to treat a 2 pixel contact sheet and a black-on-the-PPU gameover screen as the same finding,
and they are not. `class_counts()` is the single place that split is computed, so the console line, the JSON and
the page cannot disagree.

How visible a failure is. The checker says WHICH blocks break a rule. This tool also counts how many pixels a
fix would have to repaint, and sorts by that number, so worst first means most visible first: a 1024x120 sky
that breaks 3 colour slots is named above a 3 pixel cursor tint. The counting is the only thing here that is
not the checker's own arithmetic, and it is deliberately simple: an offending block's bad pixels are the
pixels that are not among the three most common colours in it (plus the backdrop for background areas), which
is exactly the set a merge has to touch.

Outputs (all deterministic; no timestamps, so a rerun either changes nothing or changed the art):
    output\\nes_audit\\<flattened path>.json     one report per file, one JSON each
    output\\nes_audit\\SUMMARY.json              every record plus the verdict
    output\\nes_audit_worst_3x.png              3x of the worst failure, offending blocks boxed in magenta
    knowledge\\NES-AUDIT.md                     the page a person reads, with coordinates and fixes

Usage:
    python tools\\nes_audit_all.py                     audit everything, write the page, exit 1 on a failure
    python tools\\nes_audit_all.py --quiet             the same with one line of output (this is the CI gate)
    python tools\\nes_audit_all.py --only title        audit only paths containing "title"
    python tools\\nes_audit_all.py --no-write          audit and report, write nothing (used by the tests)
    python tools\\nes_audit_all.py --list              print what would be audited and stop

Exit codes: 0 every gated file passes, 1 any gated failure or gated UNMEASURED, 2 nothing found.
