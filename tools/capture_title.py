capture_title.py: capture the real game window, press one Enter, capture again, then close the game.

Why this file exists: the computer-use screenshot tool returns a blank frame for some windows on this PC, so
the working method is the one recorded in Shared\\projects\\arananet\\manager\\STATE.md: find the window
rectangle with user32 GetWindowRect, then copy that rectangle off the screen with System.Drawing
CopyFromScreen. The CopyFromScreen call needs .NET, so this script calls the sibling helper
tools\\capture_rect.ps1, which does exactly that. If PowerShell is unavailable it falls back to PIL
ImageGrab, which is the same screen copy done a different way.

The launch recipe is the one Igor used for the run, recorded in build\\igor-run5.log and in DEVLOG:
    <game>.exe -game <data>.win
That argument form was measured on this PC on 2026-10-21. Two other forms were tried and both fail:
    <game>.exe <data>.win     opens a file dialog titled "Open", never starts the game
    <game>.exe                opens the same file dialog
The DEVLOG already warned that the runner opens a file dialog for its data when it is started wrong.

Usage:
    python capture_title.py             capture output\\title_run_1.png and output\\title_run_2.png
    python capture_title.py --selftest  prove the capture path on notepad, write output\\_capture_selftest.png
    python capture_title.py --video     record output\\title_run.mp4 of the running title screen and check it

Exit codes:
    0  both frames were written (or the selftest frame was written, or the video passed its checks)
    1  the game window never appeared, or the capture failed, or a video check failed
    3  the watchdog fired (the run overran)
    4  the idle gate refused to open a window: the user had input in the last three minutes (card CAPTURE-QUIET)

Quiet by default (card CAPTURE-QUIET, Nayil 2026-10-22). Every launch in this file goes through tools\pp_launch.py:
the game is started with PP_MUTE=1 so nothing plays, the idle gate in tools\idle_check.py refuses to open a window
unless the user has been quiet for three minutes, and the window is moved off the primary screen. --sound turns the
mute off for an audio proof, --show leaves the window where it is, --idle-wait polls for the user to go quiet, and
--force is the override a person at the keyboard may use on purpose.
