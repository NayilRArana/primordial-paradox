"""make_drive_map.py: the drive corridor's map row and the palette set it draws in (card t_e8a8f18a).

Why this row exists: a scene row must name a `map` id in data/maps/all.json, and the drive scene
(`drive_to_southampton`, R21b) had no map to name. This tool writes that map. It carries no art and no
shot list of its own; every number it uses is read from a file that already owns it:

    assets/tiles/drive/drive_tiles.json     the sheet: 24 tiles, their character, their palette group, the
                                            palette.json role behind every sheet role, the four groups
    data/tile_classes_drive.json            the walkable classification, which is what the collision grid is
    data/room_palettes.json                 the room palette sets, appended to (the file's own rule)
    assets/tiles/drive/TILES.md             the prose page the four background palettes are printed on

The row's two geometry numbers come from the scene it serves, not from taste:

    WIDTH 160 tiles. The shot list's L3 windows resolve through `offset = round(camera_x * 0.15) mod 512`
    (LAYERS, tools/art/make_title_world.py) to camera tile x 0, 25, 37, 83 and 141, so shot 8 needs tile
    141 plus the 16 tile frame, which is a floor of 158. 160 is the round number above that floor and the
    camera at 141 is reachable without a clamp (160 * 16 - 256 = 2304 px = tile 144).
    HEIGHT 24 tiles. A camera at tile y 8 shows rows 8 to 22 of a 240 px frame, so the map must hold 23 rows
    for that number not to be clamped (24 * 16 - 240 = 144 px, tile 9, past the 8 the scene asks for).
    ROAD_ROW 8 is the y the scene uses for all 15 of its camera commands and for its start.

The band, top to bottom. The road sits where the scene's camera already points at it, the far verge above it
and the near verge, barrier and hedge below, because a camera whose top row is the road row shows the road at
the top of the frame and the near side under it:

    rows 0 to 1    hedge mass, the far side of the corridor (blocked)
    row  2         the shadow under the hedge
    rows 3 to 4    the far verge, grass then tufts
    row  5         the kerb
    row  6         the hard shoulder
    row  7         the edge line
    row  8         the lane dash: the road row the scene names
    rows 9 to 10   the carriageway, with studs and reinstatement seams
    row  11        the near edge line
    row  12        the near hard shoulder
    row  13        the safety barrier, with four openings so the near verge is reachable
    row  14        the near kerb
    row  15        the near verge: grass, marker posts and lamp heads
    row  16        the near verge: tufts and the lamp columns
    row  17        the shadow
    rows 18 to 23  the near hedge mass (blocked)

What the row does not carry: the gantry, the sign face and the rain are film sprites drawn by the drive room
(spec 14, card R21a), not ground, so this row places no gantry tile. The sheet's sign tiles are still
colourable in this room, because the set declares their palette group.

Usage:
    python tools/art/make_drive_map.py            # print the row and what it spends, write nothing
    python tools/art/make_drive_map.py --write    # append the row and the palette set to the tree
    python tools/art/make_drive_map.py --check    # exit 1 if the tree differs from what --write would write
