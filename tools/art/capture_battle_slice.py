"""capture_battle_slice.py: one real frame of the running game in the tutorial fight, taken without any key press.

Why this file exists (card t_4275136f). tools/capture_first_fight.py is the project's evidence tool for the first
fight, and it drives the fight with 45 timed key presses from the title screen. Measured on this tree 2026-10-25: the
drive no longer reaches the fight (the title now runs an 840 frame pan and a 14 line crawl, so the presses that are
meant to skip the crawl land inside it and the game types text to the end of the recording), and nothing in this card
is allowed to guess at new timings by opening window after window. The game's own demo walk is the cheaper door: with
PP_SLICE set, pp_app walks data/slice.json, whose "fight" step is encounter tutorial_sailors on the deck, and it walks
there on its own with no input at all. This tool watches the walk's log for that step, copies one frame of the game's
3x viewport, and writes it out at 1x.

What it does NOT do: it does not press a key, it does not touch the build, and it does not claim the frame is a
player's run. PP_SLICE is a developer route and the frame is evidence that the BUILD draws the strip, the enemy and
the party at the numbers data/ui_layouts.json gives, which is this card's question. The player's path is
tools/capture_first_fight.py's job and its own card.

Rules it obeys, from tools/pp_launch.py (ruling D9): muted, no window while the machine is not idle, off the primary
screen, one launch and one exit line.
