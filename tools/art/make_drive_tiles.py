"""make_drive_tiles.py: the drive's road, gantry and barrier tile set (card t_d0e73725, DRIVE-TILES).

What this draws, and to which rules:

1. Twenty four 16x16 tiles that read as the M3 corridor at night from the side: eight road surface tiles,
   eight night roadside tiles, and eight gantry and barrier tiles. The card names four things (the corridor
   surface, the gantry sign, the barrier, the night roadside) and this sheet carries all four, plus the
   shoulder and the lane markings they imply.
2. The geometry is derived from THIS repo's OSM extract, at the repo's own tile scale. tools/osm_to_map.py
   fixes 8 m to a 16 px tile, so one pixel is 0.5 m, and every number below follows from that and from tags
   that are in data/osm_cache/:
     - the carriageway is 2 tiles wide because osm_to_map.py paints a road_major 2 tiles wide, which at
       8 m a tile is 16 m: three 3.65 m lanes plus a 3.3 m hard shoulder is 14.3 m, so it fits and a
       single tile could not hold it;
     - the lane line is a 2 m mark and a 6 m gap (4 px on, 12 px off), which is exactly one 8 m tile. The
       motorway's own 2 m mark and 7 m gap is a 9 m cycle and would need a 3 tile repeat, which this sheet
       does not guarantee, so the tile carries the 8 m cycle and says so;
     - a 3.65 m lane is 7 px, the 7 m width tagged on A3211 Victoria Embankment is 14 px of the 16 px tile,
       and a 1 px line is 0.5 m, thicker than the 0.15 m paint on the road, because the pixel is the
       narrowest thing the PPU draws.
3. Colours are ROLES from data/palette.json, and each role resolves to a Ricoh 2C02 entry through
   tools/art/nes_snap.py's NIGHT_TABLE, which is the same bridge the drive layers already use. That means
   this sheet carries exactly the entries tools/nes_check.py and the runtime see, and no pixel is an
   approximation of a 2C02 output. Nine roles, nine distinct entries, against the card's ceiling of 16.
4. Every tile draws from one of four background palettes of three roles plus the shared backdrop $0F, so
   no 16x16 attribute area can carry a fourth colour. That is the rule tools/nes_check.py measures.
5. The blob test of knowledge/SPRITE-CRAFT.md section 8.5 is measured per tile and written into the
   manifest. The four object tiles are gated on it; the pattern tiles (road, verge, hedge) and the two
   light tiles are reported with their waivers named, because the test was written for a character
   silhouette and paving is structure by repetition.

Outputs:
    assets/tiles/drive/drive_tiles.png          the sheet, 8 by 3 cells of 16x16, 24 tiles
    assets/tiles/drive/drive_tiles.json         the tileset manifest: palettes, roles, tiles, blob numbers
    assets/tiles/drive/TILES.md                 the tile table the map wiring reads
    data/tile_classes_drive.json                every tile walkable or not, with the ODbL line in its header
    output/drive_tiles_3x.png                   3x contact sheet
    output/drive_corridor_preview.png           256x240 mock of the corridor, composed from the sheet
    output/drive_gantry_preview.png             256x240 mock of the gantry and barrier, same sheet
