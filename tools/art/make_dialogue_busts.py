"""make_dialogue_busts.py: draw the 48x48 four colour dialogue busts, one hand authored grid each.

Card t_4d6b0f4b (DIALOGUE-PORTRAIT). Its parent card t_01432e14 removed a portrait frame from spec 05 because no
speaker carried a bust and `pp_dialogue_draw` drew one anyway; this card is where the bust comes back, and the card
says plainly "do not start this until the sprite exists". So the sprite exists first, in this file, before any GML
learns to draw it.

Geometry, from specs/05-dialogue.md and knowledge/GAMEDEV-DECISIONS-2026-10-23.md D10 point 3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 48x48 pixels, standing on the dialogue box's top edge at (16, 120). The box is at y 168, so a 48 pixel bust that
  starts at y 120 ends at y 167 and touches the box without covering one pixel of it.
- One pixel frame, drawn INTO the sheet rather than by a rectangle at run time: the box's draw path is one sheet and
  one call, and a frame the engine paints is a second thing that can disagree with the art.
- At most 4 colours from data/nes_palette.json, and at most 3 opaque in any 8x8 tile, because a sprite tile carries 3
  opaque colours plus transparency (ART-BIBLE 1.1 row 16). Each bust here spends exactly 4 entries and the audit below
  proves no tile spends more than 3.
- 48x48 is 36 sprite tiles, 6 to a scanline, inside the PPU's 8 sprites per scanline and 64 in OAM (ART-BIBLE 1.1
  rows 18 and 19). That arithmetic, and the box's 8 pixel padding, is why the bust is 48 and not 64.

The four entries, and why the middle is not transparent
-------------------------------------------------------
    panel  $02 navy, the dialogue window's own fill (data/palettes/scene_ui.json bg0)
    accent one per bust: the hair or helmet, and the frame
    skin   one per bust
    ink    $0F, the canonical black: the silhouette and every feature

A framed portrait with a transparent middle shows the level through its own frame, which reads as a hole rather than a
picture. So the interior is filled with the window's fill and the figure is drawn on it as ink line art: the face is
the one filled mass, the shoulders are an ink outline with a lapel line, and the hair or helmet is the accent. That is
a 3 opaque colour figure, which is exactly what one sprite tile can carry, and it belongs to the dialogue box instead
of floating over the map.

How these were drawn
--------------------
The left half of each sheet is drawn, then mirrored onto the right, so a face cannot be lopsided by a one pixel typo
and the silhouette is symmetric about the axis between x 23 and x 24. Every shape is a number in this file: the face
is 18 pixels wide on rows 9 to 30, the jaw steps in one pixel a row over rows 27 to 30, the eye is a 3x3 ink block at
x 18..20 with a 6 pixel bridge across both halves, the neck is 8 wide, and the shoulders are a trapezoid from row 35
to row 46. The ink outline is not hand listed: `outline()` recolours every pixel of a mass that touches a different
colour, which is the same 1 pixel silhouette rule tools/art/make_characters_v2.py uses.

The three busts answer the three speakers in data/dialogue/all.json that a portrait earns: the gate guard, Percy
(Poseidon) and Prometheus. Nothing was traced, ripped or resampled from any game; the proportions follow
knowledge/ART-BIBLE.md and knowledge/CHARACTER-BIBLE.md.

Usage
    python tools/art/make_dialogue_busts.py            build every bust, print the measured row
    python tools/art/make_dialogue_busts.py --dump     build, then print each frame as ASCII, numbered
    python tools/art/make_dialogue_busts.py --audit    build, then print the per tile colour audit
