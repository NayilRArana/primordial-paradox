"""make_battle_bg.py: draw the four NES battle background strips, deterministically.

Card t_1c5a8599 (BG-BATTLE). Four 256x112 strips:

    corridor    ship corridor: steel bulkheads, a pipe run, a red hatch
    wardroom    wood panelling, portholes, a long table under ceiling lamps
    deck_night  open deck at night: rigging, sea horizon, railing, deck plates
    quay_dusk   Southampton quay at dusk: bollards, a crane silhouette, water

How the NES rules are kept, by construction rather than by hope
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. The picture is drawn on the attribute grid. Each strip is 16 by 7 cells of 16x16 pixels, and every
   cell is painted from ONE of the scene's four background palettes and only from that palette's three
   colours plus the scene's one shared backdrop. So every 16x16 attribute area holds at most 3 colours
   plus the backdrop, and every colour change falls on a 16 pixel boundary (ART-BIBLE 1.1 rule 8).
2. Every colour is an entry of data\\nes_palette.json, named by its number in the scene palette file.
   The script refuses to write a pixel that is not one of those entries, so no off palette colour can
   reach the PNG by accident.
3. Flat bands and 2 pixel checkers only. Dither is the 2x2 checker produced by checker(); there is no
   gradient, no blend and no anti aliasing anywhere in this file, because nothing is resampled: pixels
   are written one at a time and the 3x preview is a nearest neighbour zoom.
4. Tiles repeat. The layout is a grid of cell letters, so the same 8x8 tile bitmap is reused wherever a
   letter repeats, the way a real NES background is built. The script counts the distinct 8x8 tiles and
   writes the count into the JSON beside each PNG (budget: 128).
5. The floor under the party block is the shared backdrop on the strips that declare `party_floor`, which is all
   four of them. The block's placement is not typed here: it is read from data\\ui_layouts.json, the battle
   screen's four sprites with role `party`, so a layout move moves the floor with it. The party bodies are the
   light entry of each hero triple and those four clear RULE 0 point 2 on the backdrop $0F and not on the mixed
   floors the corridor, the deck and the quay carried, so a strip that declares it paints role 3 (the backdrop)
   over the block and leaves every other pixel of the strip alone. The corridor and the wardroom were landed by
   card t_d64eb2a9 (section 7.4 point 2); the deck night and the quay dusk were scoped out of that card and were
   ruled in by card t_0949bd4e, so the four strips cannot disagree (section 12 point 2, drawn by card
   t_12c9b18f).

6. The scene palette file keeps the audit rows it already carries. `data\\palettes\\scene_battle_<name>.json` is
   written whole, and the `judged` list in it is a cast decision plus the row that measures it (cards t_4f18c0ac
   and t_0949bd4e), so a regeneration used to delete a ruling without failing anything. The writer now carries
   that one key forward unchanged, in the position it already holds, and refuses a file that is not a scene
   palette for the same scene rather than overwriting it. Every palette, note and hex still comes from this
   file, so the scene file keeps one owner for its numbers.

7. The `notes` list is this script's as well (card t_8ebcb489). `judged` is a whole key only a card writes, so it
   can be carried forward by key; `notes` is generator text that hand edits had been appending to, and a carry
   rule for it would need a marker telling generator lines from hand lines. So there is no carry rule: the writer
   emits `notes` whole, and a note that has to survive a regeneration is a line in the SCENES table below. Two
   notes that lived only in a written file now live there, and the two hand edited files reproduce byte for byte.

    """A one pixel ink line where one cell's material meets a materially different one.

    The ink is role 3, the shared backdrop, so this costs no palette slot: it is the same trick the party
    floor uses one screen down in this file.

    Only a real step in tone draws a line, `min_step` luma apart, and the two cells have to be different cells:
    the first attempt inked every boundary whose dominant role differed, and a review of the 3x preview said
    exactly what that looks like, "a lattice of dark lines rather than a single lit surface". A band of the same
    material repeated now stays seamless, which is what a wall is.

    `skip` is a predicate for the pixels the party floor will paint anyway. The floor is ink too, so a pixel this
    pass inks inside the block's own rectangle is a pixel the floor would have set, and the strip's own test would
    then find fewer than 1920 pixels moving when the flag is switched off (tests/test_make_battle_bg.py,
    test_the_pass_moves_the_block_and_nothing_else).
