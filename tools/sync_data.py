"""Copy data\\ into game\\datafiles\\ so GameMaker includes it in the build.

GameMaker only ships files it knows about: Included Files are copied into the game bundle, and the engine reads them
from the working directory at runtime. Rather than keep two copies of every table, data\\ is the source and this
script mirrors it into game\\datafiles\\, which tools\\gen_project.py then lists in the .yyp.

The mirror is a runtime question, not a "where does the data live" question. data\\ stays the single source of truth
for every file here, and the ones the engine never opens are left out of the bundle but stay in data\\. See
NOT_RUNTIME below for those and why.

Run order for a build:  sync_data.py  ->  check_data.py  ->  gen_project.py  ->  Igor
(`tools\\run.ps1` does exactly that).

Usage:
    python tools/sync_data.py
    python tools/sync_data.py --check      # exit 1 if the mirror is stale

# "audit" key), tools/scene_palette_set.py and tools/nes_audit_all.py. No GML file names either one (grep of
# game/**/*.gml on 2026-10-22 found no reader, and the runtime loaders in pp_data name audio, flags, items,
# palette, powers, project, room_palettes, slice and the title tables instead). Mirroring them bought nothing and
# cost something: two generated files the .yyp then declared as Included Files, so every rebuild of the palette set
# was a build input the commit had to carry or the nightly worktree reported as missing. They stay tracked in data\
# because committed tests read them there (tests/test_scene_palette_set.py loads data\scene_palettes.json).
