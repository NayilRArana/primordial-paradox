/// Card R21a. The twelve shots, their order and their durations in steps come from knowledge/DRIVE-SHOT-LIST.md
/// section 2, which is the one place those numbers are authored. The commands each shot will eventually run come from
/// specs/06-cutscene-runner.md, and the art each shot needs from specs/14-title-screen-drive.md. This file draws the
/// film at 256x240 with placeholder rectangles wherever the art does not exist yet, which the card allows, and it
/// draws every one of them from the room palette set named below and never from a colour literal (spec 13).
///
/// What it is not: it is not the scene runner. The drive block of data/scenes/all.json is card R21b's, and this room
/// answers "does the drive exist in the running game, do the twelve shots read as twelve different pictures, and does
/// no shot sit still for twenty seconds". A scene that says `say drive_radio_1` will still be R21b's to write.
///
/// The clock is the music's clock (knowledge/DRIVE-SHOT-LIST.md section 1): 60 steps a second, a shot's own duration in
/// steps from the table, and no shot longer than 1,200 steps, which is the twenty second ceiling the shot list holds.
/// Fades are 12 steps, per spec 06 and pacing 4.2. The grid is the exact one, 85.714 steps a bar at 126 bpm, and every
/// cut in the table is `round(bar x 85.714)` (decision D18, knowledge/GAMEDEV-DECISIONS-2026-10-24.md): the twelve
/// durations here are the same twelve numbers data/scenes/all.json spends, and tests/test_drive_map.py now compares the
/// two tables shot for shot so the copy cannot drift.
///
/// Capture only (decision D19). The drive that ships is the `drive_to_southampton` scene of data/scenes/all.json on the
/// map drive_m4_corridor, played by the spec 06 runner. This room exists so a capture run can write the twelve pictures
/// from inside the game: it is reachable only when PP_DRIVE_ROOM is set, which no real launch sets. It is not on the
/// route and it must not be wired into it.
///
/// The roles (card t_415541ee). The film spends four roles and no others: ink, paper, dim and text, the four every set in
/// data/room_palettes.json declares. Before this card it spent eleven, seven of which drive_night does not carry
/// (accent, window, window_edge, window_shadow, marker, marker_trail, hazard), so a draw in the set the drive map names
/// asked the palette for colours that set cannot answer and pp_role_colour answered PP_COLOUR_MISSING magenta. The rule
/// is the one card R48 settled for the battle field and t_769b545d for the dialogue box: a screen that can be drawn in
/// any room spends only the roles every set carries, and a mark that has to read against a dark field takes text, the
/// brightest of the four. The seven replaced roles map by their value onto the four: accent, marker, window_edge and
/// hazard to text (a pool, lane paint, trim and a lamp all have to read), marker_trail to dim (a trail behind a pool does
/// not), window to ink (sky, water and a caption plate are the darkest field) and window_shadow to paper (a silhouette
/// one step off ink). tests/test_drive_roles.py holds every role call in this file inside the shared four.
