"""Tests for the audio bus contract: data\\audio.json, game\\scripts\\pp_audio\\pp_audio.gml and the checker.

What is pinned here, and why each pin earns its place:
  - the cue table holds exactly the musician's seventeen ids, one row each, with a title, an asset
    name, a loop flag and a placeholder flag, so a rename cannot detach the musician's music
    from the game without a red test;
  - every cue id asked for by a map, a scene or an encounter is a row in that table, and the
    rows nothing asks for are the recorded list, not an accident;
  - the crossfade is the macro 30, not three literals, and the priorities are the spec numbers;
  - focus handling is the documented engine call, made in exactly one place, and routed through
    pp_audio_focus;
  - check_data refuses a cue id no row defines, on a private copy of data\\.

Honest limits. There is no data\\music directory and no pp_*.ogg anywhere in the tree, so no cue
has a file to play. GameMaker builds this tree and the build log shows the module loading and
playing, but no test below listens to a speaker: what is pinned is the contract between the data,
the module text and the checker. Anything about how it sounds is unproven and said so.

Defects this file still records rather than hides:
  1. Thirteen of the seventeen rows are asked for by no map, scene or encounter, and data\\audio.json
     has no "unused" marker to say so on purpose. Card item 2's second half needs a data decision.
  2. The placeholder stand-in a cue names can never play: pp_audio_music hands it to pp_audio_play,
     which refuses every name that is not in pp_audio_cues(), and none of the three stand-ins is.
  3. Focus is polled once per step from pp_audio_step, not delivered as an event, because the
     engine documents no Windows focus event. Recorded in the focus tests and on the card.
The seventeen ids the musician's round 1 note carries are all in the table now, so the shortfall
the review returned on card t_8de1aca9 is closed and pinned by a test instead of documented. They are
compared against data\\audio_cues_source.json, a rows-only copy of that note's cue table that lives
inside the game with its own provenance and VC-9b scan line (card t_a6fb94f8, decision A on
t_41553cc5), so no row here depends on a file outside this repository.

# "The Drive", assets\\audio\\pp_drive\\NOTES-v3.md prints this film's eleven hard cuts on its downbeats at 125
# bars, and the scene sums to exactly the 10,680 steps that cue is scored for, so the references are intended
# and the pin moves, not the data. The two references ride in the same commit as this pin.

#   PP-01  delivered and scored, but the title path streams it by file name through
#          pp_audio_play_theme, so no map, scene or encounter asks for the id. It needs a title
#          scene command, which is a data change this pin cannot make for it.
#   PP-08  not composed. No assets\\audio\\pp_08_dead_rising folder; the row falls back to PP-03.
#   PP-09  not composed. No assets\\audio\\pp_09_data_center folder; falls back to PP-03.
