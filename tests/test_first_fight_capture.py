"""Tests for the first fight capture's frame reader (tools/capture_first_fight.py).

Card t_da94341c. The tool had been unable to score a frame for three unrelated reasons, and none of them was covered by
a test, so it rotted silently while the suite stayed green:

    * its geometry guards still named the pre BATTLE-FONT-WIRE draw call, so the first frame check raised SystemExit;
    * its frame reader demanded exact palette pixels on frames it cuts from an h264 recording itself, so every frame it
      produced was refused;
    * its press schedule stopped one turn short of the result panel.

The reader and the FIGHT label measure are pinned here. The schedule is a number in the file, not a function, and the
run that proves it is the muted capture itself.

# Card t_f3b7c557: the recording's pixel format, at both stages, not only at the one the card happened to look at.
#
# The battle screen's dodge dim is a ONE PIXEL checker of the ink role over the field (pp_arena_draw, card t_06ef8607).
# 4:2:0 stores chroma at a quarter of the luma resolution, so each pair of one dimmed and one undimmed pixel is
# averaged into a colour neither palette file names, and the picture gate goes red on a correct picture. Measured on
# this host 2026-10-27 on a frame built from game/datafiles/art/bg_battle_deck_night.png at the game's own colours
# (union share 1.0000 before encoding), through start_recorder's settings and then cut_and_scale's:
#
#   the deck strip with the arena's dim           4:2:0 0.8393   4:4:4 0.9642
#   the deck strip without it                     4:2:0 0.9457   4:4:4 0.9916
#
# so the format is what the 0.90 gate turns on. These rows keep it at 4:4:4 in the tool. They do not re-measure the
# encoder (that needs ffmpeg and a frame); they refuse the two edits that would undo the fix silently: the recorder
# going back to a subsampled format, and run_capture cutting at the cut's own 4:2:0 default instead of passing the
# format through.
