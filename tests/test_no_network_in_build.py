"""R34 TEST-NO-NETWORK: prove the D5 promise mechanically, on the files a judge actually runs.

What this file claims, and nothing wider
========================================
`knowledge/GAMEDEV-DECISIONS-2026-10-22.md` D5 says the shipped build makes no network call, ever,
and holds no key. That is a promise about *reachability* and *credentials*, and it is the promise the
pitch makes, so it has to be measured rather than restated. This module measures it over every file
that ships: all of `game\\` (scripts, objects, options, rooms, the .yy files and the .yyp, and the
built datafiles the engine reads at runtime) plus `data\\meta_bake.json` and the top level
`data\\*.json` sources those come from.

Four refusals, and the sixth check a run has to pass to be trusted
==================================================================
1. NO CREDENTIAL NAME. The five names spec 19 and the Meta client read are refused wherever they
   appear in a shipped file: GEMINI_API_KEY, KAGGLE_API_TOKEN, PINE_SANDBOX_API_KEY, MODEL_API_KEY,
   META_API_KEY. The scan reads the NAME only and never echoes what follows it, so a key that was
   pasted into a file by mistake is named, not reprinted, and this module holds no key either.
2. NO NETWORK CALL IN CODE, WITH ONE NAMED EXCEPTION. `.gml`, `.yy` and `.yyp` files may not name a GameMaker
   network or socket function (`http_get`, `http_post_string`, `http_request`, `network_connect`,
   `network_send_*`, `url_open*`, and the rest of the list below). `async_load` is deliberately NOT on that list:
   the save system polls it for a local file write, and refusing it would refuse correct code.
   THE EXCEPTION (card t_ee178652, 2026-10-26): http_request, in game/scripts/pp_talk_live/pp_talk_live.gml only,
   pinned to exactly two call sites, because the first fight's TALK command has to ask the local AI bridge to judge
   a player's line and that is the whole point of the feature. Every other network function stays refused in that
   file too, and the promise that replaces the flat one is measured here and in tests/test_talk_live.py: the host is
   a loopback literal from data, the address is assembled at call time and never written whole, and the shipped
   build starts in replay mode where neither call is reached. See the LIVE_CALL_* block for the full statement.
3. NO URL OUTSIDE A COMMENT IN CODE. A URL in a GML comment is a citation to the engine manual. A URL
   in GML that is not in a comment is a string some function could be handed, so it is refused. Same
   rule for .yy and .yyp.
4. NO ENDPOINT AND NO CREDENTIAL IN DATA. A URL under an endpoint shaped key (`api`, `api_base`,
   `base_url`, `endpoint`, `host`, `server`, `socket`, `url` inside a request block, ...) is refused
   even in a file that is otherwise allowed to hold citations, and a URL that carries a credential
   inline (`user:pass@`, `?key=`, `&token=`, `Bearer `) is refused everywhere. A base64 blob longer
   than 4096 characters in a data file is refused: that is a key or a payload hiding from the two
   scans above. `data\\meta_bake.json` is held to the strictest rule of all: no URL at all.

THE ONE EXEMPTION, AND WHY IT IS NOT A SKIP
===========================================
This repository's shipped data legitimately carries other people's URLs: citation tables
(`data\\music_recipes.json`, `data\\drum_patterns.json`, `data\\dissonance_rules.json`) cite the
NESdev wiki and the papers they were read from, `data\\nes_palette.json` cites its palette source in
prose, and the map pipeline ships OpenStreetMap downloads whose own tags hold shop and heritage
websites. None of those is an endpoint the game can call: there is no network function in any shipped
GML file for layer 2 to miss, and layer 3 refuses the one shape that could become a call. So a data
file may hold a URL only when it proves FROM ITS OWN BYTES that it is a citation table or third party
geography:

    - it parses as a JSON object carrying a top level `generator` that starts with "Overpass API"
      (a download, not our prose), or
    - it carries a top level provenance block: `sources`, `source`, `citation`, `attribution`,
      `licence`, `license` or `provenance`, or
    - it is a Tiled map whose own properties carry an attribution or licence entry.

A plain data table (`data\\audio.json`, `data\\dialogue\\all.json`, `data\\talk_cards.json`,
`data\\project.json`, `data\\meta_bake.json`) carries no such block, so a URL planted in one is
refused. Every file the exemption covers is counted and printed by the run, so the exemption can
never widen quietly and can never be silent. What this file does NOT claim: that a URL string can be
told from an endpoint string by looking at it. It cannot, which is why the endpoint keys and the
inline credential marks are a separate, unconditional refusal, and why the report line says how many
citation files were exempted rather than reporting a clean zero.

THE SECOND HALF: THE BAKE IS STILL SERVED WITH THE NETWORK OFF
==============================================================
D5 point 3 says the demo survives a dead network. The test forces `PP_AI_MODE=replay`, removes every
key from the environment, and replaces `urllib.request.urlopen` with a trap that fails the test if
anything opens a socket. In that state it:

    a. proves the client refuses rather than calls: an unrecorded request raises CacheMiss, not a
       request, and the trap is never sprung;
    b. rebuilds every talk request from committed source data (`data\\talk_cards.json`,
       `data\\enemies\\all.json`, `data\\dialogue\\all.json`, `knowledge\\GATE-DIALOGUE.md`, the system
       text measured out of spec 19) and looks it up by `request_hash` in `data\\meta_bake.json`,
       exactly the rung 1 lookup of spec 19 section 8. Every rebuilt request has to land on the row
       written for it, so the demo shows Meta's baked lines with the network off;
    c. proves the file the engine actually reads, `game\\datafiles\\meta_bake.json`, is byte identical
       to the source it is mirrored from, because a stale mirror is a demo that shows hand written
       text while the bake looks perfect.
