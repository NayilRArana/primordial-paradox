"""The overworld's world struct and the first fight's trigger (card FIRST-FIGHT-WIRE, t_4a1a6662).

Why this file exists: the overworld crashed on the first frame of every entry into it, so no encounter trigger on
`ship_small` could ever fire. Build log of the run that found it (`build/first_fight_game.log`, card t_87ee4228):

    PP title: intro finished, starting the run in rm_pp_ship
    PP CRASH: Variable <unknown_object>.steps(100104, -2147483648) not set before reading it.
              | at gml_Script_pp_overworld_draw line 478

The cause was one missing key: `pp_overworld_new` built the world struct without `steps`, and `pp_overworld_draw` hands
`_world.steps` to `pp_map_draw` (for the animated tiles) on the very first draw. GameMaker is not installed on this PC,
so nothing here can execute GML. What it can do is read the module and the data as text and pin the class of failure:

  1. every `_world.<name>` the overworld module reads or writes is declared by the struct `pp_overworld_new` builds,
     which is the check that would have caught the crash before a build;
  2. the world clock is declared at 0 and climbs by one in `pp_overworld_step`, so the value handed to the map draw is
     a counted clock rather than a default;
  3. the first fight is reachable on foot from the map's own spawn: a `battle` trigger two tiles east of `start`, on
     walkable tiles, with no condition, naming an encounter whose enemy row exists;
  4. starting an encounter prints one unconditional log line naming the encounter, which is the line this card's check
     reads out of the run.

Sources this file measures, never restates: game/scripts/pp_overworld/pp_overworld.gml, data/maps/all.json,
data/encounters/all.json, data/enemies/all.json.

No test here reads the network, writes a data file, launches the game or needs a key.
