"""Tests for tools/bake_meta.py (card R29 META-BAKE, spec 19 sections 2 to 11, D5).

What is pinned here, in the order the card argues it:

1. `--offline` is total. Every fight phase the data can reach and both NPCs get three option rows, every
   row is fallback sourced, and the file records where each fallback came from (a card pool line in
   data/talk_cards.json, or a line id in knowledge/GATE-DIALOGUE.md).
2. The shape is spec 19's. Every line is inside the font alphabet and at most 28 characters, at most 4
   lines, the mood is one of five, the effect is one of five and legal for the scene, and no row carries
   the string `spare`.
3. `--check` refuses what the card says it refuses: a line over 28 characters, an effect outside the
   enum, and a fallback id that does not exist in data/talk_cards.json. It refuses four more that keep
   the file honest: a URL or a key name, a hash that does not recompute, an offline row claiming a live
   answer, and a bake block whose counts disagree with its rows.
4. The offline bake never calls the client, a valid live answer is written as live, and a refused answer
   falls back with the reason recorded, so no row can claim a call it did not make (R43's check 4). R43 B1
   is pinned the way the review measured it: backend meta, a placeholder key and replay mode with nothing
   cached writes mode offline, network false and an offline note over 18 fallback rows, and the live header
   the old code wrote over those same rows is refused.
5. R43 B2 is pinned the same way: a fallback row whose text, mood, effect or hint is not its fallback's is
   refused, and a reason that names none of the bake's causes ("because") is refused too.
6. The file is ASCII with no long dash, which the manager and the pre-commit hook both require.
