"""The build step must distinguish "the build passed" from "the build was never measured".

Written with the 2026-10-19 change that made a GameMaker-less machine report honestly. Before it,
tools/integration_build.py returned 0 for run.ps1's exit 2, so the push output read
"integration primordial-paradox-build: PASS ... BUILD SKIP": an unmeasured step reported as measured.
It now exits 3, and suite_config.json declares 3 as that step's unmeasured result, so the gate prints
UNMEASURED and never PASS.

run.ps1 is not executed here. subprocess.run inside the tool is replaced with a stub that returns the
exit code the real script returns, which is exactly the branch under test.
